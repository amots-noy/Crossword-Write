# Crossword-Write

This is a project I initiated in order to start studying HTML-CSS-JS.

The aim of the project is to enable writing conviniently over an image of a crossword.

The writing should be possible both vertically and horizontally and be limited to the white squares.

At first stage the image of the crossword is hard-coded. Later I intend to enable pasting of arbitrary image and writing over a third party web page.
